A Java-based workflow for creating and managing relationships between nodes in a Neo4j graph database, leveraging metadata exported from PostgreSQL. This project focuses on establishing standard meta-data relationships to enhance the graph structure after node insertion.

---

## Features

- Automates relationship creation between various node types in Neo4j.
- Integrates PostgreSQL data exports with Neo4j graph database.
- Modular Java classes for relationship management.
- Uses Neo4j Java Driver for database connectivity.
- Logging support with SLF4J for process tracking and error handling.

---

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Neo4j (Graph Database)
- PostgreSQL (Data source assumed)
- SLF4J (Logging)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Neo4j database instance
- PostgreSQL database with relevant data
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management (assumed)

### Installation & Running

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/supreme-court-meta-relationships.git
cd supreme-court-meta-relationships
```

2. Build the project (assuming Maven):

```bash
mvn clean install
```

3. Configure Neo4j connection settings in `Neo4jConnection` class (not included in repo snippet).

4. Run the `RelationshipCreator` class to create relationships:

```bash
java -cp target/your-jar-file.jar com.supreme_court_transfer.RelationshipCreator
```

---

## Project Structure

- `index.md` - Documentation and explanation of the workflow.
- `com.supreme_court_transfer.RelationshipCreator` - Java class responsible for creating relationships between nodes in Neo4j.
- `Neo4jConnection` (assumed) - Utility class to manage Neo4j sessions.

---

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand relationship creation to cover additional metadata types.
- Implement error recovery and retry mechanisms.
- Add configuration options for relationship types and properties.
- Provide detailed documentation and examples for integration.
- Automate data export from PostgreSQL to Neo4j within the workflow.
- Add unit and integration tests for relationship creation methods.
